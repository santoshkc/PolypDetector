# PolypDetector
Polyp Detector using Detectron 2 from facebook AI research.

* Uses Faster RCNN with Feature Pyramid Network(FPN)
* Uses pretrained weights of ResNet-50 for faster training and better accuracy.
*  **mAP** around 41 was achieved by training on reduced image size. 
* In progress(tuning hyperparameters to reduce false polyp detection rate)
* Experiment with other data augmentation techniques to enhance accuracy.
